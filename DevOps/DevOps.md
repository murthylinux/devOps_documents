* **POST:** Submits data to a server to create a new resource or initiate an action. Often used in APIs to create new items, trigger builds, or start deployments.

* **PUT:** Updates a resource or data on the server. Used in APIs and automation to edit existing information or re-configure existing resources.

* **PATCH:** Applies partial updates to a resource on the server. Utilized when only a certain part of the data needs an update, rather than the entire resource.

* **DELETE:** Deletes a specific resource from the server. Use this method to remove data, stop running processes, or delete existing resources within automation and APIs.

* **HEAD:** Identical to GET but only retrieves the headers and not the body of the response. Useful for checking if a resource exists or obtaining metadata without actually transferring the resource data.

* **OPTIONS:** Retrieves the communication options available for a specific resource or URL. Use this method to identify the allowed HTTP methods for a resource, or to test the communication capabilities of an API.

* **CONNECT:** Establishes a network connection between the client and a specified resource for use with a network proxy.

* **TRACE:** Retrieves a diagnostic representation of the request and response messages for a resource. It is mainly used for testing and debugging purposes.

**Answer**
git pull and git fetch are two distinct commands in Git that serve different purposes, primarily related to updating a local repository with changes from a remote repository

git pull is a combination of git fetch and git merge. It retrieves data from the remote repository and automatically merges it into the local branch.

git fetch is used to retrieve data from remote repositories, but it does not automatically merge the data into the local branch. It only downloads the data and stores it in the local repository as a separate branch, which means the developer must manually merge the fetched data with the remote branch.

### **Q25. What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?**

**Answer**
A container and a virtual machine are both technologies used for application virtualization. However, there are some key differences between the two.

A virtual machine runs an entire operating system, which can be resource-intensive, while a container shares the host operating system and only includes the necessary libraries and dependencies to run an application, making it lighter and more efficient.

Containers provide isolation between applications, while virtual machines provide complete isolation from the host operating system and other virtual machines.
