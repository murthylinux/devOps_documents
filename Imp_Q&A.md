### **What’s the difference between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment?**

**Continuous integration (CI)** executes the sequence of steps required to build and test the project. 
CI runs automatically on every change committed to a shared repository, offering developers quick feedback about the project’s state.

**Continuous delivery** is an extension of CI. Its goal is to automate every step required to package and release a piece of software. 
The output of a continuous delivery pipeline takes the form of a deployable binary, package, or container.

**Continuous deployment** is an optional step up from continuous delivery. 
It is a process that takes the output from the delivery pipeline and deploys it to the production system in a safe and automated way.
