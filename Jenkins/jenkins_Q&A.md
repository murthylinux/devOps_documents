# Interview Questions and Answers:

### Continuous Integration (CI):

1. **What is Continuous Integration, and why is it essential in software development?**
A: Continuous Integration is the practice of regularly integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests. It ensures that changes do not break existing functionality and helps identify and fix issues early in the development process.

2. **Explain the concept of a CI/CD pipeline.**
A: A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that facilitate the continuous integration and delivery of software. It typically includes stages like code compilation, testing, artifact generation, and deployment.

 **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
3. What is Continuous Deployment, and how does it differ from Continuous Delivery?
A: Continuous Deployment is the practice of automatically deploying every code change to production after passing automated tests. Continuous Delivery, on the other hand, involves automatically deploying to a staging environment, with the final production deployment triggered manually.



How do you handle secrets and sensitive information in CI/CD pipelines?
A: Secrets management tools, such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, can be used to securely store and retrieve sensitive information. CI/CD platforms should integrate with these tools to ensure secure handling of secrets.
