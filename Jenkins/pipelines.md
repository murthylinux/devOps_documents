### Explanation for the Interview:
Pipeline Stages:

* **Checkout Code:** Fetches the source code from GitHub.
* **Build Code:** Compiles the code using tools like Maven.
* **Run Tests:** Runs unit tests to ensure code quality.
* **Docker Build and Push:** Builds a Docker image and pushes it to AWS ECR.
* **Deploy to Kubernetes:** Updates the Kubernetes deployment with the new Docker image.
* **Monitor and Notify:** Sets up application health checks and sends email notifications for success or failure.

#### Key Features of the Pipeline:

Automates the entire CI/CD process, reducing manual effort.
Ensures deployment to Kubernetes is smooth and error-free.
Includes monitoring and rollback mechanisms to handle failures.
Benefits:

**Faster delivery of applications.**
Improved application stability and reliability.
Seamless integration with cloud infrastructure (AWS) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
