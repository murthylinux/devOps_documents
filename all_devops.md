18. *What is the role of version control in DevOps?*
    - *Answer:* Version control, typically using Git, is crucial in DevOps as it enables collaboration, maintains code history, supports branching and merging, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

19. *How do you manage secrets in a DevOps environment?*
    - *Answer:* Secrets can be managed using tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Kubernetes Secrets. These tools securely store and access sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and certificates.

20. *What is blue-green deployment?*
    - *Answer:* Blue-green deployment is a strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments. One environment (blue) is live while the other (green) is idle. Updates are deployed to the green environment and, after testing, traffic is switched to it.

### Scenario-Based Questions
21. *Describe a scenario where you would use canary deployment.*
    - *Answer:* Canary deployment is used when you want to deploy new features to a small subset of users to minimize the impact of potential issues. If the new features work as expected, the deployment is gradually expanded to the entire user base.

22. *How would you implement rolling updates in Kubernetes?*
    - *Answer:* Rolling updates in Kubernetes can be implemented using the kubectl set image command to update the deployment's container image, which Kubernetes then gradually updates while maintaining application availability.

23. *How do you handle a situation where a build fails in Jenkins?*
    - *Answer:* Handling a failed build involves reviewing build logs, identifying and fixing code errors, checking dependencies, validating configurations, and re-running the build.

24. *What steps would you take to migrate an application to a microservices architecture?*
